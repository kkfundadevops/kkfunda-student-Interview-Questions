# ðŸ’¼ DevOps Interview Questions â€“ Accenture Focused

### âœ… 0. Tell Me About Yourself

**Answer:**

> I am a DevOps Engineer with __X years__ of experience working on CI/CD automation, cloud infrastructure (AWS), and container orchestration using Docker and Kubernetes.  
> My expertise spans across tools like Git, Jenkins, SonarQube, Maven, Terraform, and monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.  
> In my last project, I worked on setting up a full CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, integrated SonarQube for code quality, containerized the applications using Docker, and deployed them on a self-managed Kubernetes cluster with Helm charts.  
> I also automated infrastructure provisioning using Terraform on AWS, implementing scalable architecture using EC2, ALB, S3, and RDS.  
> I focus on delivering stable, repeatable deployment pipelines and proactive monitoring to reduce production incidents.
